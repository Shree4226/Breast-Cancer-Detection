# Project Brief: Breast Cancer Detection using ML and DL

This project focuses on developing an automated breast cancer detection system using both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The primary objective is to assist in early diagnosis by accurately classifying histopathological breast cancer images from the BreakHis dataset.

The project involves preprocessing and normalizing medical images, applying feature extraction using advanced self-supervised learning models like DINOv3, and training classification models with metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to rigorously evaluate performance. A comparative analysis between ML and DL models helps identify the most robust approach for reliable detection.

Overall, the system aims to support medical professionals by improving diagnostic speed and accuracy, contributing to better patient outcomes through early breast cancer identification.
